Ultimate Crossword
======================

**Deprecation notice:** I have decided to retire the Ultimate Crossword project. It was a fun side project, but I can't justify the hosting costs anymore.

Scripts to generate CouchDB/Solr databases can be found at https://github.com/nolanlawson/ultimate-crossword.

Summary
--------

The Ultimate Crossword is a webapp based on an XKCD comic.  Details can be found on [the FAQs page][2].

Building
---------

This is a basic Yeoman app.  You should be able to install it with:

```
bower install http://download.pouchdb.com/pouchdb-nightly.min.js # because pouch isn't in the bower repo yet
grunt
```
